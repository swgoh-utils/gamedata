# swgoh-gamedata.
This should be updated automatically within about 10 mins of a new update pushed for the game
all the collections are structured as 
```
{version: 'CURRENT_VERSION', data: []}
```
the units.json is filtered for obtainable === true and obtainableTime === '0' (this should be player obtainable units)

the units_pve is filtered for obtainable !== true or obtainableTime !== '0' (this should be pve units)

the versions.json has `gameVersion` and `localeVersion` that is only updated with the current game and locale version if all files where uploaded successfully. 
The versions of the files may be update before these are due to upload errors

It is recommended to just pull this file and compare to stored values before pulling all the files.
